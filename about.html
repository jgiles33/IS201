                        <p>Growing up in the vibrant heart of Mission Viejo, CA, after being born in the quaint town of Safford, Arizona, my journey has been anything but ordinary. I'm the youngest of four, with two protective sisters and an older brother who've always set the bar high, pushing me to chase my dreams with unwavering determination. As the baby of the family, I've had the unique privilege of learning from my siblings' triumphs and challenges, shaping me into who I am today. Now, at 23, I find myself navigating the complexities of adulthood, majoring in Finance and minoring in French at BYU. This blend of disciplines, as peculiar as it might seem to some, speaks to my love for numbers and my fascination with the French culture and language, a duality that encapsulates my academic pursuits and personal interests.</p>
                        <p>My time at BYU has been a pivotal chapter in my life, not just academically but also spiritually. Serving a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Ivory Coast transformed my outlook on life, ingraining in me a profound sense of purpose and a deeper understanding of global cultures and humanity. This experience, combined with my passion for finance and French, has fueled my ambition to make a meaningful impact in the world. Beyond academics and mission work, I've always found solace in the exhilaration of sports. Whether it's a competitive game at the park with friends or the simple joy of body surfing and basking in the sun at the beach, these moments of physical exertion and connection with nature are where I feel most alive.</p>
                        <p>Looking ahead, I'm stepping into a new beginning, as I'm getting married this August. It's a significant milestone that marks not just the union with my partner but also the start of our journey together, facing life's challenges and celebrating its joys hand in hand. As I reflect on my journey from Safford to Mission Viejo, from the Ivory Coast back to BYU, and now towards marriage, it's clear that each chapter has been integral in shaping my path. The blend of cultures, the pursuit of education, the thrill of sports, and the companionship of loved ones have all woven together to create a tapestry of experiences that define me. I stand at this juncture of my life, eager to see where the next wave will take me, with my heart open to the adventures that lie ahead.</p>
